but you shouldnt see the 3 demoloop projects on the right (those are mine)

Follow the video below to open the project you just downloaded:

you just opened the project, congratulations!!!

(I forgot to delete the readme, but delete yours)


plug your iphone into your mac, if you get a message on your phone saying "trust this computer" click trust and enter your phone password

follow the video below to make sure it builds the app onto your iphone:

Once again follow the video below to make sure you can actually run the app on your phone, if you dont do this youll get an error saying it couldnt install because the integerety could not be verified

When you click on team you should see the apple id you used to set up the app, if not click on add team and enter your apple id

the two errors that your seeing on my screen you shouldnt encounter, there because if you dont have a apple developer account (costs 100$) you can only sign up to 10 app id's per week and ive reached that limit

then click on the play button in the top left corner:

you should see a message on your mac saying "build succeeded" click "ok"

it might take a minute but you should see a new downloading app somewhere on your homescreen... congratulations!!! but theres probably one more step you need to do

if you press on the app and says it couldnt verify it all you have to do is go to: "settings -> general -> VPN and device managment" you shoud see "DEVELOPER APPS" with your email under it. tap on your email and you should see "DemoLoop" with "Unverified" next to it, tap on it and press "Verify"

then everything will work!!!!!!!!!

if you want to change the video that it plays when you open the app follow the video instructions:

IMPORTANT!!!: make sure the video is named "demo" spelt exactly like that with the video type being "mp4" if any of these are diffrent you will just get a black screen and dont select "Move files to destination" select "Copy files to destination"
